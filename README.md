## Deploy
If you want to play with your friends, you can do so in a few minutes by deploying on Heroku. To do so just click the button below, register, follow the instructions and you're done!

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

### Configuration
If you deployed on Heroku, instead of having to change the `pyx.properties` file, you can do everything from their website:

- Go to the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), and select your app
- Select the `Settings` tab and click on `Reveal Config Vars`
- Add your configuration here using the same key names as in the configuration file (e.g. use `pyx.server.max_users` as `KEY` and `200` as `VALUE`)
- Restart your app (select `More` near `Open app` on the top and click on `Restart all dynos`)
- You're done!


## Build
To build this using Maven run `mvn clean package`, then execute `java -jar target/PYX-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. You can now edit the `pyx.properties` file to customize the server.

For GeoIP functions to work, download http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLite2-City.mmdb.gz somewhere, gunzip it, and update the geoip.db value in `pyx.properties` to point to it.

## Server discovery API
Due to the recent unavailability of the main PYX servers I've implemented the server discovery feature. It allows any server to be discovered by the main API which will then provide a list of available servers for everyone to connect to them.

By default this feature is disabled. To enable it:

 - Find your `pyx.properties` file
 - Set `pyx.server.discovery_enabled` to `true`
 - Set `pyx.server.discovery_address` to your external IP address or domain
 - Set `pyx.server.discovery_port` to the external port+
 - (Optional) Set `pyx.server.discovery_metrics` to the metrics base URL
 - Open the necessary ports on your router/firewall
 - Deploy! In a few minutes, if your configuration is correct, your server will appear [here](http://discovery.pyx.gianlu.xyz/ListAll).
